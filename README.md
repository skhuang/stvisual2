An interactive visualization project for software testing concepts, including testing method taxonomy, testing flow, common testing types, graph coverage analysis, and logic (predicate / clause) coverage analysis.

## Why This Project

- Turns software testing concepts into an interactive visual teaching tool
- Demonstrates graph-based coverage criteria with concrete requirements and test paths
- Supports editable graphs so users can see coverage recomputed immediately
- Shows optimization impact by comparing path counts before and after reduction

## Feature Highlights

- Visualizes testing method categories: black-box, white-box, gray-box, and their sub-techniques
- Animates the testing workflow from requirements analysis to defect reporting
- Shows common testing levels: unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing
- Provides graph coverage visualization for:
  - Node Coverage
  - Edge Coverage
  - Prime Path Coverage
  - Edge-Pair Coverage
  - Complete Path Coverage
- Automatically generates test requirements
- Automatically generates test path sets
- Applies a greedy set-cover approximation to reduce the selected test path set
- Displays before/after optimization metrics and saved path count
- Lets users edit the graph structure live with nodes, edges, start node, and end node inputs
- Provides logic coverage visualization for:
  - Predicate Coverage (PC)
  - Clause Coverage (CC)
  - Combinatorial Coverage (CoC)
  - Active Clause Coverage variants: GACC / CACC / RACC
  - Inactive Clause Coverage variants: GICC / RICC
  - Syntactic (DNF-based) criteria: IC / UTPC / NFPC / CUTPNFP
- Renders the truth table, identifies major / minor clauses, and marks duplicate test rows
- Computes a minimized DNF via Quine–McCluskey and renders Karnaugh maps for `f` and `¬f`
- Lets users enter custom predicates and persists recent ones as removable chips (synced to Firestore when signed in)

## Showcase Notes

- Deployable to GitHub Pages
- Works directly from `file://` by using a standalone fallback bundle
- Includes both unit tests and real browser tests
- Covers the major graph coverage features with automated tests

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the local static server

```bash
npm run serve
```

Default URL: <http://127.0.0.1:4173>

### 3. Open the app directly from the file system

You can also open `index.html` directly.

The app supports two entry modes:
- `http/https`: uses the modular runtime entry
- `file://`: automatically switches to the standalone fallback to avoid module CORS restrictions

## Testing

### Unit tests

```bash
npm run test:run
```

### Browser E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:browser
```

### Browser tests with UI

```bash
npm run test:browser:headed
```

## GitHub Actions

The repository includes two workflow groups:

- `Test`
  - `unit-test`
  - `browser-test`
- `Deploy GitHub Pages`
  - builds the Pages artifact after tests pass
  - deploys the static site to GitHub Pages automatically

Relevant workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

## Graph Coverage Focus

The graph coverage section currently supports:

- requirement generation
- test path generation
- approximate minimal test path selection
- live graph editor recomputation
- UI metrics for optimization before and after path reduction

This project is useful for:
- teaching graph coverage concepts
- comparing different coverage criteria
- observing the mapping between requirements and test paths
- demonstrating path reduction with a set-cover style approximation

## Logic Coverage Focus

The logic coverage section currently supports:

- parsing arbitrary boolean predicates over named clauses (`&&`, `||`, `!`, parentheses)
- enumerating the full truth table and the determining (active) rows per clause
- generating test requirements and concrete row selections for PC / CC / CoC / GACC / CACC / RACC / GICC / RICC
- DNF-based criteria (IC / UTPC / NFPC / CUTPNFP) with Quine–McCluskey minimization, including implicants of `¬f`
- minimizing the IC test set via greedy set cover and striking through duplicate rows
- rendering Karnaugh maps for `f` and `¬f` (for n = 3, columns are `ab`, rows are `c`)
- a textbook-style DNF notation (adjacency = AND, `+` = OR, overline = NOT)
- a curated list of built-in predicates plus user-supplied recent predicates

## GitHub Pages Deployment

To prepare the static site output locally:

```bash
npm run pages:prepare
```

This command:
- regenerates `src/standalone.js`
- builds the `site/` output directory
- prepares the artifact structure used by the GitHub Pages workflow
